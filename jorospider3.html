		<p id="five"> DO NOT TOUCH THEM </p>
		<p> While the spiders may not be poisonous, they can still bite you which can be very painful!
		<p> Only trained professionals should handle these creatures 
		<p> Symptoms can range from minor to very severe so precautions should be taken when approaching not only these spiders, but also spiders in general.</p>
		<p class="head">SEVERE SYMPTOMS</p>
		<ul> 
			<li> Difficulty breathing</li>
			<li> Nausea and vomiting </li> 
			<li> Fever</li>
			<li> High blood pressure </li>
		</ul>
		<p class="info">Severe symptoms for this family of spiders is very rare. These symptoms usually arise in those who are allergic to spider bites, or have a preexisting complication that may have been affected by the bite. However, even if you may not be allergic to spider bites, treat every bite with urgency and care. </p>
		<p class="head">MINOR SYMPTOMS</p>
		<ul> 
			<li> Itching and/or rash</li>
			<li> Pain/irritation around the bite area</li> 
			<li> Muscle aches</li> 
			<li> Formation of blisters</li> 
		</ul>
		<p class="info">Minor symptoms are more common, and can be treated within a week or two. Spider bites take longer to heal compared to other incest bites/stings, so don’t worry if the bite doesn’t go away for a few days. However, keep track of your symptoms, because some people may experience delayed reactions/complications.</p>
		<p class="head">HOW TO TREAT THE BITE</p>
			<ol> 
				<li> Identify the bite area</li> 
				<li> Clean the area thoroughly with soap and water and apply antibiotic ointment</li>
				<li> Apply a cold damp cloth over the bite area to reduce swelling and discomfort</li> 
				<li> If the bite is on an extremity, such as your arm or leg, elevate it to allow better blood flow</li> 
				<li> If the pain is getting a bit uncomfortable, taking over the counter pain relievers as instructed is perfectly fine</li> 
				<li> Keep an eye on the bite for a few days and keep track of your symptoms</li> 
				<li> Keep the area clean and repeat treatment when needed</li>
			</ol> 
		<p class="important"> <span>If the bite area seems to be getting worse, or is causing extreme pain, contact a doctor immediately and recieve professional medical attention!</span></p>
		<p> Again, Joro Spiders are solitary creatures, so the last thing they want is to be held abruptly</p>
		<p>So, for these spiders and other animals that aren't your dog or cat, admire them from a distance because at the end of the day, both you and the organism will be happy!</p>
