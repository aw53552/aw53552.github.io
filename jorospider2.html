		<p class="head"> Where are the spiders found? </p>
		<p class="info">The Joro Spider is native to many parts of Eastern and South Eastern Asia. The most prominent countries that the spiders are found in are China, Korea, Japan and Taiwan. The Joro Spider has only very recently reached the United States with the focal point of the population being in Northeast Georgia. The spiders are found in urban areas in Asia, however, they prefer to stay in the deep woods. Like most spiders, the Joro is a solitary creature, so usually you’ll only see one when you encounter them. As for how the spiders came to Georgia, it was really just pure chance! What most researchers suspect is that the spiders came all the way here by catching a ride on a shipping container. With Savannah, Georgia being a major shipping port, it’s very likely that this was the case. The first sightings in Georgia were back in 2013, and only in 2020 did the spiders make their way to the Athens area.</p>    
		<p class="head"> Why are they called orb weavers?</p>  
		<p class="info">The reason why these spiders are also called orb weavers is due to the unique shape of their webs. The Joro Spider, and many of its relatives, spin webs in a very distinct, circular pattern which resembles an orb or a sphere. The Joro Spider’s webs have another level of distinction due to their coloration. If the sunlights hits the webs just right, the webs will have a golden hue to them. This isn’t the sun playing mind games with you, the Joro Spider actually spins golden webs. You can usually find their webs strung up between two trees or branches, and the webs themselves can span up to three feet in length with some being smaller or larger. So, if you ever find yourself walking in the forest, keep your eyes peeled or you may end up getting a face full of golden web and may have to deal with a very angry spider!</p> 
		<p class="head">How can you tell them apart? </p>
		<p class="info">When looking at the Joro Spider, it may be confused with the native Banana Spider. Both of them have yellow and black striped legs, and both are also orb weavers as well, so it’s a bit difficult to differentiate between the two without getting close. However, the main differences between the two spiders lie in their abdomens. The Joro Spider has a yellow striped back, while the Banana Spider has a solid yellow back. And the biggest difference is that the Joro Spider has a very vibrant red underbelly that almost resembles rose petals. If you see all of the listed characteristics, it’s a safe bet that you found a Joro Spider. Whether that’s a good thing is for you to decide... But if you do wish to get a closer look, please admire them with your eyes and try not to disturb them too much.  The last thing we want is to have a new species harmed when they’ve only just arrived.</p>     
		<p class="head"> Is it bad that the Joro Spider is here? </p> 
		<p class="info">While it’s too early to call whether or not having the Joro Spider in the US is a good thing, what we do know is that there have been no immediate, major disturbances since their arrival. They have had to compete with other spiders for territory, however, this hasn’t led to any major population shifts. What researchers have also found is that the Joro spider has become a food source for other organisms, such as, birds and wasps. So again, it’s too early to tell, but it seems like the Joro Spider will fit right in.</p>
